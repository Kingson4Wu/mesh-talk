```

## Prerequisites

- Rust 2021 edition or later
- Cargo package manager

## Installation

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mesh-talk.git
cd mesh-talk
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Run the application with your desired name and port:

```bash
cargo run -- --name YourName --port 8000
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `--name` or `-n`: Your display name in the chat
- `--port` or `-p`: The TCP port to listen on for incoming connections

## How It Works

1. The application creates a mesh network where each node can communicate directly with other nodes
2. UDP broadcast is used for peer discovery on port 8888
3. TCP connections are established between peers for reliable message delivery
4. Messages are broadcast to all connected peers in the network

## Technical Details

- Uses Tokio for async runtime and networking
- Implements UDP broadcast for peer discovery
- TCP for reliable peer-to-peer communication
- JSON serialization for message encoding
- Thread-safe peer management using Arc and Mutex
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns

## Dependencies

- tokio: Async runtime and networking
- serde: Serialization framework
- serde_json: JSON serialization
- clap: Command line argument parsing

## Development

This project follows a professional Rust project structure — a layered workspace where the
protocol core is its own crate (`mesh-talk-core`) and the desktop app is a thin shell over it:
- Node orchestration in `crates/mesh-talk-core/src/node/`
- Crypto in `identity/`, `transport/` (Noise), `ratchet/`, `channel/`, `dm.rs` (all in the core crate)
- Event log + sync in `crates/mesh-talk-core/src/eventlog/`; signed discovery in `discovery/`
- At-rest encryption in `crates/mesh-talk-core/src/storage/`; auth (app-only) in `src-tauri/src/services/`
- Full architecture reference: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Automation and Code Quality

The project includes several automation tools to maintain code quality and consistency:

### Code Formatting and Linting
- Automatic code formatting with `cargo fmt` and `prettier`
- Linting with `clippy` for Rust code
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality

### Development Automation
Use the provided Makefile for common development tasks:
```bash
make dev        # Run in development mode
make build      # Build for release
make test       # Run tests
make lint       # Run linting tools
make fix        # Automatically fix code issues
make format     # Format code
```

### Automated Maintenance
The project includes scripts for automated maintenance:
- `scripts/check-health.sh` - Run all quality checks
- `scripts/auto-maintain.sh` - Run regular maintenance tasks
- Pre-commit hooks that automatically format and fix code before committing

### CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow that runs all quality checks
- Automatic security scanning for dependencies
- Build verification on multiple platforms
